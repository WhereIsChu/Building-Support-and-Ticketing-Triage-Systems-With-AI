**What’s In This Repo (Start Here)**  
This repository contains the deliverables from a Founding Customer Support Engineer take‑home project. Each file is a standalone artifact; together they represent a complete support “starter kit” for an AI workspace product.

- **`Workbook_-_Support_Triage_System-…`**  
  The operational tracker. A structured triage spreadsheet for logging incoming tickets, tagging type/severity, tracking status, and capturing escalation context. This is the day‑to‑day system a support team would use.

- **`Support_Triage_Guide-…docx`**  
  The operator playbook. Defines how to classify tickets (Bug / Feature / Support), assign priority (P1–P3), what info to collect, and how to escalate to engineering. Includes templates and examples.

- **`Customer_Response_Samples-…`**  
  Tone and response reference. Channel-specific support replies (email, live chat, social) that demonstrate how to respond like a real human while still being efficient and technical when needed.

- **`Critical_Support_Problem_AI_Agent_Trust_…`**  
  Scaling risk analysis. A deep dive on the most likely support/ops problem as usage scales: AI trust erosion, output validation, and how those issues create high-cost tickets. Includes preemptive mitigation ideas.

- **`Building_Support_Systems_with_AI_Proce…`**  
  Process documentation. Explains how the system was built, what decisions were made, and how AI was used to accelerate research, iteration, and structure without replacing judgment.

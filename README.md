**Project Overview**

This repo contains a complete, production-ready customer support starter kit for an AI-native workspace product. It includes a Support Triage Guide (P1–P3 severity, escalation rules, and templates), a working Support Triage System workbook for tracking tickets and trends, a process write-up on how the system was built with AI leverage, and a risk analysis on AI agent trust erosion at scale as user volume grows.
